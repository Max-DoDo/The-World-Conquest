## Note before meeting

* Rejoin new members

* Get to know the original members better

* Made changes to the content of the first meeting, such as:

  1. Changing the original game style  from Chinese style to mixed style.

  2. Deepen team members' understanding of UI engine.

     * The really important point here is to improve the division of labor within the group and strengthen the group members' cognition of their respective tasks. With the gradual progress of the task, there will be more difficulties waiting for us, so we need to let everyone know their own tasks before the task starts, so that the future cooperation will not be shelved by hardships.
    
 *  About the reassignment of work.
      * Still need 2-3 coders and UI designers. With the addition of new people, we can redistribute the work and have someone take care of the documentation. We changed the playtesters to one of our original coders. The project manager position still exists, as to whether the project manager will be eliminated in the future, it needs to be confirmed in a future workshop.
   * Production standards
       * In this meeting, the usage habits of members for documents and codes are unified, and all members will use github together to complete this task.
  
  * After the meeting

      * After the meeting, all the members were still working on how to finish the task better on the way back. In order to keep the atmosphere from being too serious, everyone had a beer.
