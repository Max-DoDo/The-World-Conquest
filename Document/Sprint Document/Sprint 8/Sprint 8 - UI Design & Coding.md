## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the userâ€™s needs***

As a client, I want the game to run smoothly in the battle interface, and when you hover over an area, it shows you that area and its information. At the end of the game, the winning player is shown.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***

**Feature: Avatar Customization**

- **Description:** Allow players to choose their avatars, including changing colors, to personalize their gaming experience.
- Requirements:
  - Provide avatar selection in the team interface, and provide color selection.
  - The selected color is prohibited from being selected again to prevent the same color from appearing.

**Feature: Inviting Friends to the Game**

- **Description:** Enable players to invite friends to join the game, enhancing social interaction and gameplay experience.
- Requirements:
  - Integrate a friend-invite system using email or social media links.
  - Ensure that the game's matchmaking system can accommodate both invited friends and AI players.

**Feature: Adding AI Players**

- **Description:** Players should be able to add or delete computer-controlled players (AI) to their game, choosing from various difficulty levels.

- Requirements:

  - Develop AI players with different levels of difficulty (weak, medium, strong).
  - Allow players to select AI opponents' difficulty before starting a game.
  - Implement AI behavior that reflects the selected difficulty level in terms of strategy and gameplay.

  **Feature: UI design**

  - **Description:** By creating different modules and lists, players can better navigate the information and make choices during the game. At the same time, a better picture layout can make the player more comfortable during the play process.

    - Design multiple avatars and colors for the player to choose from.
    - Better typography for easier browsing.

## Test plan and evidence of testing



## Summary of sprint

```
It's been a heavy week. Since the process of the game was written in advance, this part can be done well. Along the way, the team members gave suggestions on how to optimize the game process, such as adding zooming functions, and the team members did a good job of modifying the game process. We didn't finish building the AI this week. The team built a simple AI a few weeks ago, but it wasn't enough for this game. Because creating an AI is difficult and takes a lot of time to test, it was not completed this week. The team decided to continue building the AI over the weekend and the following week, and if they couldn't finish the AI the next week, they would only be able to submit a simple AI. The UI design team will add more details to the game this week, such as finding the most representative pattern for the areas on the map, and preparing to make the pattern into a flag. The difficulty facing UI design is the creation of modules. In order to make it easier for the player to choose, we will expand the options of some modules, and design it so that when clicked, a module will provide options. As the UI part is self-taught by the team members, the previous graphic design is very different, so the team members responsible for UI design are very busy this week. Because the interface is built at your fingertips, you just need to wait until the modules are designed and added to the game. Next week is the deadline for homework, I hope everyone can make a better version of the game before the deadline.
