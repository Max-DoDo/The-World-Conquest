## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the userâ€™s needs***

As a client, I want the game to run smoothly in the battle interface, and when you hover over an area, it shows you that area and its information. At the end of the game, the winning player is shown.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***

**Feature: Avatar Customization**

- **Description:** Allow players to choose their avatars, including changing colors, to personalize their gaming experience.

## Summary of sprint

This week has been quite demanding for the team. Despite having the game's process outlined in advance, there were still challenges to overcome. However, the team handled them adeptly and even suggested optimizations, such as incorporating zooming functions, to enhance the gaming experience. These suggestions were promptly implemented, showcasing the team's flexibility and commitment to improvement.

One area where progress fell short was in the development of the AI. While a simple AI had been created in previous weeks, it proved insufficient for the current game's requirements. Building a robust AI is a complex and time-consuming task, leading to its postponement. To address this, the team plans to dedicate additional time over the weekend and the following week to further develop the AI. However, if completion proves elusive, the team will resort to submitting a simplified version.

Meanwhile, the UI design team is diligently working on enhancing the game's visual appeal. This includes refining area patterns on the map and preparing them for incorporation as flags. However, the challenge lies in creating modular designs that offer expanded options for players. Despite being self-taught, team members responsible for UI design are fully immersed in their tasks, striving to deliver a cohesive and engaging interface.

As the deadline for the project approaches, there's a collective determination among team members to deliver a polished and refined game. With everyone's dedication and collaborative efforts, we aim to present an improved version of the game that exceeds expectations
