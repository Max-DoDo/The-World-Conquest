## User Stories 

***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the userâ€™s needs***

 As a client, I want the text to be easy to read, but not too generic. The interactive button works properly and displays its corresponding function successfully and correctly. After entering the game, I want to see a clear map, and each area should be able to display the specific information of the area.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards

***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***

#####  Words design

* Make sure all text content in your app is highly readable, using clear, easy-to-understand language and avoiding overly technical terminology. At the same time, text layout, font size and color should not be too common and too complex.

#####  Functionality of interactive buttons

* Ensure that all interactive buttons in the application work properly, and that each button can display and trigger the corresponding function. This requires adequate interface design and functional testing to avoid any possible user interface issues such as unresponsive buttons, functional errors, or interface layout problems.

#####  Clarity and information presentation of the graphics in the game

* Map clarity: In-game maps should be designed to be both beautiful and useful, so that users can intuitively understand the layout of the map when they enter the game. Each area on the map should be clearly identified so that users can easily navigate.
* Area information display: When the user selects or enters a specific area on the map, it should be able to display specific information about that area, such as the number of soldiers. This requires the interactive design of maps and regional information to be intuitive and easy to understand.
