## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the user’s needs***

As a customer, I hope that this game can not only be played with friends, but also have a better game experience when the player is playing alone. I wanted all the buttons in this game interface to give feedback as the player interacted.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***
* ### Requirement Analysis
    
    **Feature: Enhanced Solo Play Experience**
    
    - **Description:** Ensure that the game is equally engaging and rewarding when played alone, providing a fulfilling experience without the need for other players.
    - Requirements:
      - Implement AI or computer-generated content that adapitates to the player’s skill level and provides a challenging but fair gameplay experience.
      - Make sure players can choose the intensity of AI players when adding AI players, so that both newcomers and people familiar with the game can have a good game experience.
    
    **Feature: Interactive Button Feedback**
    
    - **Description:** All buttons in the game interface should provide immediate and clear feedback when interacted with by the player to enhance usability and responsiveness.
    - Requirements:
      - Design buttons with visual and/or auditory feedback for interactions such as hovering, clicking, or pressing.
      - Ensure that feedback is intuitive and consistent across all game interfaces.
      - Test button feedback on various devices to ensure responsiveness and visibility under different game conditions and screen sizes.

## Summary of sprint

```
As for this week's task, the AI player did not complete the construction, because it is a huge project, but under the joint cooperation of the two team members, a preliminary work has been completed. In this regard, the team decided to give them more time to complete the work, and we planned to complete the work during the Easter holiday and the first week after the holiday. As for button interaction, the team decided after discussion to add the UI after feedback during UI construction, as a result, when the player clicks the button with the mouse, the button will show a dip and shadow as interactive feedback. After the holiday, the last three weeks will come. I hope the team members can get back to work as soon as possible after the holiday. If the assigned task cannot be completed due to the holiday, after group discussion, the group decides to involve members who can provide help. If a member falls ill during the holidays and is delayed from work, we will take the same approach to these tasks. Thanks for everyone's contribution to this project. I hope that after the holiday, the team members can keep a positive working attitude, so as to facilitate the work in the future.
