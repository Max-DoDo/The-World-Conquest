## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the user’s needs***

As a customer, I hope that this game can not only be played with friends, but also have a better game experience when the player is playing alone. I wanted all the buttons in this game interface to give feedback as the player interacted.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***
* ### Requirement Analysis
    
    **Feature: Enhanced Solo Play Experience**
    
    - **Description:** Ensure that the game is equally engaging and rewarding when played alone, providing a fulfilling experience without the need for other players.
    - Requirements:
      - Implement AI or computer-generated content that adapitates to the player’s skill level and provides a challenging but fair gameplay experience.
      - Make sure players can choose the intensity of AI players when adding AI players, so that both newcomers and people familiar with the game can have a good game experience.
    
    **Feature: Interactive Button Feedback**
    
    - **Description:** All buttons in the game interface should provide immediate and clear feedback when interacted with by the player to enhance usability and responsiveness.
    - Requirements:
      - Design buttons with visual and/or auditory feedback for interactions such as hovering, clicking, or pressing.
      - Ensure that feedback is intuitive and consistent across all game interfaces.
      - Test button feedback on various devices to ensure responsiveness and visibility under different game conditions and screen sizes.

## Summary of sprint

```
While we have devised a plan to complete the project and allocated more time for team members to finalize their tasks, it's crucial to recognize the significant possibility of project delays. Given the project's extensive scope and multifaceted nature, it's plausible that team members may not be able to complete all tasks within the specified timeframe. Moreover, unexpected occurrences such as illnesses or the need for additional rest during the holiday period may arise.

To mitigate potential delays, we have discussed several contingency measures. Firstly, we aim to accomplish as much work as possible during the Easter holiday and the first week following the holiday to ensure project progression. Should any team member be unable to fulfill their assigned tasks during the holiday period, we will engage in collective discussions to mobilize other team members capable of providing assistance, thereby ensuring that the project remains unaffected by individual circumstances.

Furthermore, we have decided to incorporate button interaction features during the UI construction process based on feedback received. While this decision aims to deliver a more comprehensive and user-friendly product, it also introduces additional time to the project, thereby increasing the risk of delay.

Lastly, I encourage team members to maintain a positive work attitude and swiftly return to work mode after the holiday period. We will closely monitor the project's progress and take necessary measures promptly to address any delays. I extend my gratitude to everyone for their contributions to the project, and I believe that with collective efforts, we can successfully complete this vital task.
