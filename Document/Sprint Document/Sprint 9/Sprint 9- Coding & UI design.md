## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the userâ€™s needs***

As a client, I want to see a complete game before the project deadline, and the game will be able to run normally, without black screens and flash back. I hope that the picture of the game is suitable for the theme of the game, not unrelated to the theme of the picture. Hopefully the graphics of the game will be improved.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards

## Test plan and evidence of testing



## Summary of sprint

```
The last week was tough, whether it was code or testing. We still have a report to finish this week on the group. At the same time, the team members made changes to the class diagram and added complete classes. In this week, the team members completed their work one after another, and finally checked that all the documents were complete, and decided that one member of the team should submit the final assignment. I am very grateful to the team members for their efforts in this project. Although we encountered many difficulties in the process of completing this task, under the leadership of the team leader, we solved many problems through communication and teamwork.
