## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the userâ€™s needs***

As a client, I want to zoom in and out as I play, so it's easier to see the message. At the same time, I want each block to display all the information it contains. As for the fonts and maps, I would like to see them optimized.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***

* **Description:** Players should be able to zoom in and out during gameplay to better view the game map and messages. This feature should be easy to use and accessible, with smooth transitions to enhance the user experience.
* Requirements:
  - Implement a zoom functionality that adjusts the view of the game environment.
  - Ensure that the zoom feature can be easily controlled by keyboard shortcuts or on-screen controls.
  - The zoom should be fluid without causing lag or reducing game performance.

**Feature: Information Display on Game Blocks**

- **Description:** Each block within the game should display all the necessary information clearly and be fully visible regardless of the zoom level.
- Requirements:
  - Design blocks to automatically adjust the display of information based on the zoom level.
  - Ensure all critical information remains legible and is not truncated.
  - Implement dynamic resizing of text and icons within blocks to maintain clarity at different zoom levels.

**Feature: Optimization of Fonts and Maps**

- **Description:** Fonts and maps within the game should be optimized for better clarity and performance across different devices and resolutions.
- Requirements:
  - Select and standardize fonts that are easy to read and visually appealing across all game elements.
  - Optimize map graphics for clarity at various zoom levels without losing detail.
  - Ensure that font and map optimizations do not affect the game's loading times or performance.

## Test plan and evidence of testing

This week will test whether the UI design from last week works properly in unity, and test whether the code you build works properly and whether there are bugs.

The experimental evidence for the image uploading problem will be described in text, the details of which can be seen on the Git Hub. Tested ver0.0.4.The spelling error in Launch_Screen is modified, and the problem of jumping to the wrong scene when the scene jumps in Main_Menu_Button is detected.

## Summary of sprint

```
The work for this week has progressed relatively smoothly. While completing the task, we encountered some challenges along the way. During code execution, a bug emerged which prevented it from running properly. The tester provided feedback and engaged in discussions and collaboration with the coder to rectify the issue, they fixed a lot of formatting errors, name spelling errors, task division and summary not being detailed enough. Additionally, after consulting with team members, the designer decided to enhance the UI design by incorporating more intricate details and making changes to materials and colors, resulting in a comparatively satisfactory outcome. Simultaneously, team members made revisions to previously uploaded advanced documents. Through effective communication and cooperation among everyone involved. We encountered many problems this week, but with the cooperation of my team members, I successfully solved them. I hope that in the next week's work, the team members can continue to actively participate in the team task and complete the task with high quality.
