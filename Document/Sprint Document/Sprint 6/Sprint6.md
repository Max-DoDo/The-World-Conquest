## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the user’s needs***

No user story for this sprint.


## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Users will have to choose between playing against a real person or a human machine within the game. Therefore, we need to design an AI operation that meets the customer's needs and allows the user to choose the difficulty of the game. Secondly, in terms of game sound, we focus on better game experience. Therefore, we looked for game sound effects to emphasize the game process.***
