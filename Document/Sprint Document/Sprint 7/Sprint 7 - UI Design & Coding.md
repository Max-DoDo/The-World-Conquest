## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the userâ€™s needs***

As a client, I want to be able to choose how my avatar looks, including colors, to personalize the experience. As an online game, I want to be able to invite friends into the game, and I want to be able to add computer players if I'm playing on my own. I wish I had a list of computer player strengths to choose from, such as weak, medium, strong.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***

## Test plan and evidence of testing



## Summary of sprint

```
The work for this week has progressed relatively smoothly. While completing the task, we encountered some challenges along the way. During code execution, a bug emerged which prevented it from running properly. The tester provided feedback and engaged in discussions and collaboration with the coder to rectify the issue. Additionally, after consulting with team members, the designer decided to enhance the UI design by incorporating more intricate details and making changes to materials and colors, resulting in a comparatively satisfactory outcome. Simultaneously, team members made revisions to previously uploaded advanced documents. Through effective communication and cooperation among everyone involved, we successfully accomplished this week's task.
