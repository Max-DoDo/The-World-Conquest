## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the userâ€™s needs***

As a client, I want to be able to choose how my avatar looks, including colors, to personalize the experience. As an online game, I want to be able to invite friends into the game, and I want to be able to add computer players if I'm playing on my own. I wish I had a list of computer player strengths to choose from, such as weak, medium, strong.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***

## Summary of sprint

This week's progress was notably smooth, though not without its challenges. While tackling the tasks at hand, we encountered a significant obstacle during code execution, which manifested as a bug hindering proper functionality. However, through constructive feedback from our testers and collaborative efforts between the coder and the testing team, we managed to identify and resolve the issue efficiently.

Moreover, our designer took a proactive approach to enhance the UI design by integrating more intricate details and refining materials and color schemes. This decision, made after thorough discussions with team members, resulted in a significantly improved outcome, elevating the overall user experience.

Additionally, our team diligently revisited previously uploaded advanced documents, ensuring accuracy and completeness. This attention to detail and commitment to excellence underscore our dedication to delivering high-quality work.

By fostering effective communication and fostering a spirit of cooperation among all team members, we successfully overcame the challenges encountered and accomplished our objectives for the week.
