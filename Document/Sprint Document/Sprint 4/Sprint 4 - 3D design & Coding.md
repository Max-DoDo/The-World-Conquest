## User Stories 
***Note user stories, the more detailed the better, without using technical language or abstracting the userâ€™s needs***

As a client, I want the game to have more design elements in the play interface, and to run the game interface smoothly. Hopefully the main interface will incorporate some 3d elements.

## Requirement analysis / Task Cards
***Analyze user stories, split them into different needs, and then decompose them into task cards***
* ### Requirement Analysis
    
    **Feature: Enhanced Design Elements in the Play Interface**
    
    - **Description:** Improve the visual appeal and user interaction of the game interface by incorporating more sophisticated design elements.
    - Requirements:
      - Design a more dynamic and visually appealing game interface.
      - Ensure that new design elements do not clutter the interface or detract from user experience.
      - Implement animations and transitions to enhance visual feedback during gameplay.
    
    **Feature: Smooth Interface Operation**
    
    - **Description:** Ensure that the game interface operates smoothly, with minimal lag or performance issues, even with enhanced design elements.
    - Requirements:
      - Optimize interface elements for performance, particularly animations and dynamic effects.
      - Test the interface across various devices to ensure consistent performance and responsiveness.
      - Use efficient coding practices and technologies to maintain high frame rates and responsiveness.
    
    **Feature: 3D Elements in the Main Interface**
    
    - **Description:** Incorporate 3D elements into the main interface to enhance the visual impact and attract more users.
    - Requirements:
      - Select and implement a 3D engine compatible with the game's existing development platform.
      - Ensure that the inclusion of 3D elements does not significantly increase the game's loading times or hardware requirements.

## Test plan and evidence of testing

This week we tested ver0.0.4.The spelling error in Launch_Screen is modified, and the problem of jumping to the wrong scene when the scene jumps in Main_Menu_Button is detected. 

The evidence can be seen in the pictures in the file.

## Summary of sprint

```
In this week's work, the 3d design is the most difficult. The material, quality and effect of the design object were very difficult to achieve, so the team members selected the material and other elements of 3d design after many discussions and screening. The rendering of the 3d design was also difficult to meet expectations, and the team decided to find a better computer to render the 3d design. With the cooperation of various aspects, the team members completed the 3d design. In terms of code, because the code itself is the largest work of this project, the team members also worked very hard to complete the work. In the post-test, we found a typo in Launch_Screen and detected a problem with jumping to the wrong scene when scene jumps in Main_Menu_Button. Testers and coders actively discuss and find problems, fix them, and eventually fix them. Under the leadership of the group leader, the group members all finished their work.
