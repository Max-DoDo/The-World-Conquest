## Issues discussed at this meeting

**1. Detailed changes to the UI**

* Last week, we discussed the UI, and this week we saw the results of the UI, but it has not reached the desired effect, so we decided to continue to refine and strive for perfection.

**2. Regarding the issues discussed in seminar** 

* During seminar we asked about the writing of sprint documentation.

* Jake told us that we could write in sprint about what we did wrong on this week's tasks, how we should correct what we did wrong, and what the results were.

**3. Have the game up and running by Thursday of this week**

* Write the code into the text first, do soft coding.

* Make the game a beta version for easy testing and correction.

* Make the game simple to interact with


## Risk manipulation

**At this stage, members of the Group have been unable to attend the meeting in time.**

* Solution: Due to personal issues, team members could not attend the meeting in time to discuss how the project should be developed next. In this case, we have taken appropriate measures so as not to affect the progress of the project.


## Other Remarks

* We need more details to get better
* We need strong debate instead of "whatever"
