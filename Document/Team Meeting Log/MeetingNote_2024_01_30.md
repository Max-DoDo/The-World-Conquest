## Note before meeting

* Get to know other team members. 
    * This is the first time we see each other. It is important to get to know each other before starting a project.

* Get to know who is good at which part of this project.

* Discuss which tech we are going to use in this project.
    * In this part, people should going to discuss more than one way to achieve the goal, such as:
        * We are going to use Unreal as the UI engine. **OR** It is no nesseary to build a 3D project in this simple board game.
        * The way we implement "multiplayer mode" is the simplest hot seat mode, **OR** LAN connection based on IP and TCP protocols, **OR** using a server for remote connection.

    * The things that really important to mention here is: As the technology we use becomes increasingly difficult. The more **RISK** we had to take. It is important to let everybody get to know what risk we are facing to.

* Very simple and rough allocation of future work.
    * We need at least 2-3 coders and UI designers. In addition, according to the standard software design process, we need at least one test engineer. If necessary, we may need a separate person responsible for documentation.

    * As for the project manager, my opinion is that it is not necessary. So this is something worth discussing with the group members: Should we eliminate the project manager and let more people devote themselves to work that seems to be more useful?
        * The advantage of this is that we can provide more output, but we will not have enough professional people to manage the project and study risks. This may need to be discussed by everyone at every meeting.

* A quick discussion where to start.
    * At least it doesn’t start with coding. A standard large-scale software should start with understanding customer needs.

* Production standards.
    * For any document, code, UI file and so on. There needs to be a standard to limit the habits of different members.Otherwise, the products of different members will be difficult to read and modify together. 

* first goal.
    * After this meeting, what do we need to do and by what time?

* Beer time!
    * Invite group members to drink. Group meetings should not be too serious.

## Issues discussed at this meeting

1. **We get five members in this team and maybe get one more guy in this week.**
    * This guy is Max's friend and nobody have ever see him before.
    * A group of six people may not be as good as a group of five people in terms of ratings etc.

    **Result of discussion:(DONE)**
    * Max have to check the recording about how the lecturer talking about the group size. After obtaining accurate answers, inform all group members before the end of the first week. If cannot get a clear answer, Max should send an email to the lecturer.

    * If there is no answer by **Monday of the 2nd week**, new people will NOT be allowed into the group.

2. **How group members communicate with each other online.**
    * Not only do we need offline communication, but in some cases we need online discussions. Email is not a good idea for us. It is completely inefficient. We need real-time communication software (*you may receive messages at 3 o'clock in the middle of the night*)(*but you can mute it and ignore it*). Also, as a group of people working on a software, we needed something that could collaboratively view, upload, and download project files.

    **Result of discussion: (DONE)**
    * All people dicide to use `Wechat Group` as the way to communication online.
    * Max suggest to use `Github` as the way to allocate the project file.
        * Other members are not familiar with `Github`, we will spend time learning it.
        * Before the third week begin, **ALL** members should learn how to use `Github`.

3. **How to manage our work progress**
    * Nobody have any idea about this issue.
    * Max and Wu suggest to use `Microsoft Team`,`Microsoft Planning`,`Microsoft Outlook` come together as a way to distribute work. But nobody are familiar with those software.

    **Result of discussion: (DONE)**
    * All people dicide to use `Microsoft Team`,`Microsoft Planning`,`Microsoft Outlook` as the way to management the work process.
    * Before the third week begin, **ALL** members should learn how to use `Microsoft Team`,`Microsoft Planning`,`Microsoft Outlook`.

4. **Who for What?**
    * After a long period of discuss, we dicide there should be:
        * 2 coder
        * 1 UI engineer
        * 1 test and document
        * 1 designer and project manager
    
    * `Tao Yiwen` are really good at UI design. He wanna try `Unity` or `Unreal`. He is also good at `C++`.
    * `Song Zhenmao` good at `C++`, and he want to learn how to be a tester.
    * `Wu Tong` good at `Python`
    * `Max Wang` good at `Java`
    * `Sun Weiyi` are really good at learning any new technology. She want to try to design and management this project.

    **Result of discussion: (DONE)(TEMP)**
    * `Max Wang`, `Wu Tong` for coding
    * `Tao Yiwen` for UI
    * `Song Zhenmao` for test and document
    * `Sun Weiyi` for design and management

        *This list is working temporary, It is very likely that it will be modified later*

5. **Which technology we are going to use?**
    * Max suggest to use `Unreal` or `Unity` to build a very professional project. But it may have to take too much risk. and another option is use `Java Swing` or `JavaFx` as UI. He had such experience to design UI by Java.
    * `Tao Yiwen` trying to use `3Dmarks` to design UI.(Whatever. I don't know anything about this stuff)

    **Result of discussion: (DONE)**
    * We think the game will generate fewer files. So it is no necessary to use a Database. Any document, file, userdata generate by the game are going to save by IO in disk.
    * We are going to use `Unity` as the UI engine.
    * Every team member have to learn a little bit `Unity` and `C#` before week 3rd start.

6. **User need?**
    * User need is the most important part in software design. everybody have read the doc published by the professor. 
    * **We need more details to get better!**
        *  Everyone should pretend to be a user while working and imagine what is not perfect and what needs improvement. Then bring it up in the meeting. Let all team members decide whether this requirement needs to be added.
    * **We need more Opinion!**
        * Everyone should try to put forward different suggestions on an issue based on their own understanding. **We need strong debate instead of "whatever"**

    **NO NEED FOR A RESULT(DONE)**

7. **Where to start**

    **Result of discussion: (DONE)**
    * We currently being "study and design" part. for week 1. everyone going to learn the stuff above.

8. **Production standards.**
    * This part `Max` was forget to mention in the meeting...
    * Here is the plan for the standards:
